	The only required objects are the Backpack, which spawns in Rekhi
112, and a flashdrive in Leo's office. There are some other objects
around, such as a chair in the Rekhi lounge. You can move around most
of Rekhi in different directions, using forward, back, in, out, left,
right, up, and down.
	The backpack is in Rekhi 112 where you spawn. Then, with the
backpack go to Leo's office to get the flashdrive. To pick up the
flashdrive, you have to make him feel awkward and cry in front of
him, using the cry command.
	The TA's are in the Rekhi lounge and Rekhi 113. I also recomend
you check out the CSLC and going outside while you're playing. Also
the third floor hallway.
